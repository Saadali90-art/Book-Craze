  {
    heading: "Write Every Day",
    text: "Build a simple daily habit, even if you only write for ten minutes. Small, steady effort trains your brain to show up, reduces fear of the blank page, and keeps your story warm in your mind. Daily writing also helps you find your natural voice and rhythm. Over weeks, a few lines become pages, and pages become chapters.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Read Widely and Often",
    text: "Reading different authors, genres, and styles grows your sense of language, pacing, and structure. Pay attention to how openings pull you in, how chapters end, and how dialogue sounds natural. Keep a notebook of lines you love and techniques you notice. The more you read, the more tools you carry into your own writing.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Outline Before You Write",
    text: "Create a simple roadmap so you know where your book is going. List major scenes or chapters, the main conflict, and the ending you hope to reach. An outline does not lock you in; it guides you when you feel lost. With clear steps, you write faster and waste less time rewriting aimlessly.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Embrace Imperfect First Drafts",
    text: "Give yourself permission to write messy pages. First drafts are for discovery, not perfection. Capture the idea, the emotion, and the movement of the story. If you judge every sentence, you will slow down and lose energy. Finish the draft first. You can shape, cut, and polish later with a calmer mind.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Set Clear, Small Goals",
    text: "Break your big dream into simple targets, like three hundred words a day or one scene per session. Tracking small wins builds confidence and keeps momentum strong. Use a calendar, checklist, or progress bar to see your growth. Clear goals reduce stress, increase focus, and make finishing your book feel possible.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Develop Real Characters",
    text: "Give your characters desires, fears, and flaws that feel human. Ask what they want, why they want it, and what stands in their way. Let them make choices that cause consequences. When characters feel real, plot grows naturally from their actions. Readers connect to people first, then to events around them.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Show, Don’t Only Tell",
    text: "Use actions, senses, and specific details to let readers experience the scene. Instead of saying someone is angry, show the tight jaw, short replies, and shaking hands. Concrete images make feelings believable and memorable. Balance showing with clear telling when needed, so the story stays smooth and easy to follow.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Protect Focus and Reduce Distractions",
    text: "Choose a calm place and a set time for writing. Silence notifications, close extra tabs, and keep only the tools you need. A short timer can help you start. When your attention is protected, ideas flow faster, and you write with greater joy. Make this quiet space a regular meeting with your book.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Seek Feedback and Revise",
    text: "Share your draft with trusted readers who understand your goals. Ask what moved them, where they felt confused, and which parts dragged. Listen without arguing, take notes, and rest before revising. Good feedback shows blind spots, while revision turns a rough draft into clear, strong pages that respect your reader’s time.",
  },
  {
    heading: "Polish Language and Proofread",
    text: "After big revisions, smooth your sentences. Trim extra words, fix grammar that breaks understanding, and choose simple, direct language. Read aloud to catch rhythm problems and awkward lines. Clean pages feel professional and help your story shine. When the writing is clear, readers can focus on your message, not your mistakes.",
